With 7 years of experience, I talk both "tech nerd" and "business speak" fluently. Whether you have the next great idea, you just need help getting it out of your head and into a product — or — you have a clearly defined set of project requirements, I'm your man. Let's build a secure, user-friendly, and performant application together!

I am passionate about working with the best technologies for each context, helping people, and software engineering. I love what technology has done for businesses and consumers, and there is no doubt it is going to have a continued effect throughout the world moving forward.
